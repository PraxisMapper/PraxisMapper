Requirements: 16+GB RAM (Will still page frequently with the most complicated areas, but they all finish in ~45 minutes in the worst case with an SSD)
Global database is current ~45GB, would want at least 64GB RAM for a DB server to hold everything in memory.
TODO: check if EFCore.BulkExtensions custom version is used by Larry, or if that's being overwritten by the NuGet version. It's not used on the web server app, so im not sure i need that custom file.


Important Things to Remember:
* This is not a MapTiles server, in the way that MapBox, or Google Maps Playable Locations, or Niantic etc. would provide.
-- https://openmaptiles.org/ is the place to go for a server that generates map tiles.
* This is a way to track Interesting Areas, and the game can decide how to display the map separately, or how Interesting Areas are treated.
* It's OK to do something that's already been done your own way. It's important to have an option that isn't under corporate control.
* We use PlusCodes instead of S2 cells.
-- Plus Codes are more human-friendly, in that you could remember 4-10 digits for a certain area. S2 cells are much harder to remember for a person. They're designed for indexing in a DB faster.
-- They're square along cardinal directions. S2 cells are rhombus-shaped.
-- A human can figure out how to navigate between 2 PlusCodes with some practice. This is possible on S2 cells, but requires much, much more effort.


How to run this:

1) Create and configure SQL Server for this app. Update connection string, create DB via EFCore docs in Commands file. (or use LocalSQL instant-instance setup?)

2) Download the latest .osm.pbf files to use from Geofabrik.de (or another OSM mirror) and unzip them to the appropriate folder.
--Global data takes a long time to process, use the smallest data file/set reasonable for development and testing.
--State-level is usually reasonable. Some specific areas have issues processing because of the amount of detail on some things. (Norway and Quebec have a ton of water entries in tiny details, for example)

3) Assuming this is a first setup, Run Larry with these arguments in order (separately is ideal, but could do all at once with enough RAM):
-createDB (Creates DB according to the connection string.)
-trimPbfFiles(reads all .osm.pbf files in a folder, saves as JSON data to another folder. May take several runs to complete depending on RAM and file size being processed. Might get replaced or removed in the future since this no longer creates smaller files.)
-readMapData (Reads the JSON files for MapData, saves to DB)
-(optionally, on loading multiple files) removeDupes (Eliminiate duplicate entries. Seems to happen because a Way appears in its entirely across file boundaries (EX: the Great Lakes border the US and Canada, and might be on both files since they are a boundary)

for changes that affect everything (EX: I changed tag types to process, i want new ways/updates from OSM), run Larry with -resetPbf and -resetJson, then follow step 3 again
For changes that only affect processedWays/SPOIs (EX: testing a better approximation algorithm for ProcessedWays, changing schema on SPOI db table), i can read in existing JSON files instead of OSM XML 

Server-side:
Set AWS Security rules to only allow RDP from a narrow range (single IP if possible, /24 block for ISP if not.)
deploy API app to its own folder, make sure IIS is pointing at folder with .exe and .dll files. Turn off Managed Code. 
Upload database file to S3, copy file to server (instructions how TBD)
Attach database to Sql Server (with or without SSMS installed? how TBD)

test API endpoint. /mapdata/test should return "OK" if IIS is up and running. actual data endpoint should return stuff with valid inputs if DB is running and connected correctly.
Should return something on error so I can figure out why a call doesnt work. I also think I need to upload a new DB to the server

Set these as the arguments for Larry to redo everything at once:
-cleanDB -resetPbf -resetJson -trimPbfFiles -readSPOIs -readRawWays -removeDupes


Notes:
Database side:
Querying spatial data:
DECLARE @p1 geography
  SET @p1 = geography::STGeomFromText('POINT (-53.235222 21.536760)', 4326)
  SELECT * FROM MapData
  WHERE @p1.STWithin(place) = 1



 Logic:
 * If a node has an interesting place tag, treat it as a single point of interest
 * If a way has an interesting place tag, and is a polygon or a linestring,
 ** Check if it's area is smaller than a 10-cell (.000125 degrees)
 *** If so, treat it as a single point of interest
 ** Make a MapData entry for the area.
 * If a relation has an interesting place tag, treat any areas inside it as that type.
 * Relations might be named by a node with a Label tag instead of a name tag on the relation.


 Test Functions:
 -AnalyzeAllAreas
 ** this reads every cell on the globe for info, saves it to a new DB table.
 ** For evaluating if its better to calculate the end results once and just save that instead of looking them up every time and caching in memory.
