Larry
Larry is the behind-the-scenes guy that gets all the work done for you.
The console app thats the start of setting up your location based game server.

Typical use:
Place the .pbf you want to use to create the server from in a folder.
Update the configuration files with the values you want to use.
Run "Larry -makeServerDb" from the command line and wait for the command to succeed.

Configuration settings definitions:
DbMode: Which database backend to use. Valid options are SQLServer, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL
DbConnectionString: The connection string for the selected database. 
PbfFolder: The path to the folder containing 1 or more .osm.pbf files to process. Must end with the trailing slash (\ on windows, / elsewhere)
OutputDataFolder: The path to the folder containing the output files from processing. Must end with the trailing slash (\ on windows, / elsewhere)
OnlyTaggedAreas: If true, only loads data that matches from a style set into your database. If false, loads all data from the source into your database, allowing for updating styles without reparsing files.
ForceStyleDefaults: if true, skips connecting to the database and uses the default styles and gameplay areas. If false, loads styles from the database, allowing for customization and additional styles.
UseGeomDataFiles: If true, will save output files to a different format that may load to the database faster.
UseOneRelationID: If 0, loads all data from the source files to the database. If any other number, loads an OSM Relation with the given number, and only saves data that overlaps with that relation.
LogLevel: Sets how much data to display on the console window/log file. 1 does no logging, 2 only displays error messages, 3 is the default, and 4 includes additional error messages and details not normally relevant to use.
KeepElementsInMemory: If false, operate normally and efficiently. If true, stores results in memory instead of loading them to a database. Useful for confirming output files are valid and drawing large images without a server running.
mapTileScaleFactor: Baseline gameplay map tiles are drawing to have 1 pixel == 1 Cell11 plus code, making an 80x100 image. This resolution is multiplied by the scale factor to determine final output size.
slippyTileSize: determines the square size of slippyMaptiles on your server.
AreaBuffer: Adds this much space when loading places from the database. Requires to draw elements that have drawn components that overlap tiles without the element itself doing so (EX: Points drawn as a circle, or names written as text)

Advanced Commands:
-createDB --Create an empty PraxisMapper database on the server Larry is configured to connect to.
-resetPbf --renames all the .pbfDone files in the configured folder to their original extension, if you want to re-process them.
-resetJson --Renamed the .jsonDone (or MariaDB geomData and tagsData) files in the configured output folder to .json so you can reload them into a database.
-processPbfs --Reads through OSM extracts in .pbf format from the configured PbfFolder, and processes them into a format that PraxisMapper can use. Can be resumed if the process is cancelled. Usually saves output to an intermediate file.
-loadProcessedData --Read the file output from the processing step, and loads them into the database. 
-createStandaloneRelation --Instead of making a database for a webserver, creates a SQLite db for an offline game with no network access. Approximates each area to a rectangle, and saves maptiles to a folder or a table.
-createStandaloneBox --As previous command, but uses a bounding area provided in the command instead of a relation in the file.
-createStandalonePoint --as previous command, but makes a game for a 6-digit PlusCode cell centered on the given coordinates.
-autoCreateMapTiles --Searches the database for areas that need map tiles created, skips empty ones. Runs a search on a global scale, but doesn't draw tiles with no data. Intended for very large game areas, not required for a typical server setup.
-drawOneImage:234567 --given a PlusCode after the colon, draws a PNG file of that PlusCode. Requires KeepElementsInMemory to be true to work.
-processCoastlines:file.shp --Reads a shapefile to create polygons representing the oceans, which don't usually have elements in OSM to represent them.


NOTES:

You may need to use the SqlLocalDb command from powershell in order to start/stop/delete a localdb instance.
When using the LocalDB option, you CAN connect to it from SSMS. The connection string will be "(localdb)\Praxis" on default settings.
